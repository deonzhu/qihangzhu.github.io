-  Mainly involves Self-programming modeling; Inverse and Forward Dynamics; Multi-body kinematics; Biomechanics; 
Model optimization and prediction based on intelligent algorithms.
-  Design and participate in speed skating motion capture experiments; Complete biomechanical characteristics analysis 
based on experimental data, and achieve drag reduction and energy saving.This part of work is carried out with Opensim. 
-  Build a simple 3-D speed skating model which mimics the observed motion and predict the blade forces of the skater 
based on the optimization algorithm. This self-programming work is carried out with Matlab.

-  12/2019-06/2020 _The general design of the multi-rotor tethered fire-fighting drone_
-  Mainly involves Multi-rotor UAV, Tethered UAV, General Design, Modeling and Simulation, PID Controller
